Add a README file for Practical 3
# Overview
* This practical demonstrates:
  *  Calculation of approximate sum of trigonometric function and comparing it with the natural logarithm of 2.
  *  Usage of *math.h* library and its functions sch as *tan*, *M_PI*, *logf*, *fabs*.
  *  A for loop to iterate over a trigonometric function and calculate the sum at the end.
  *  Calculating the absolute and relative differences between the sum and log(2) using *fabs* function.
  *  Ensure that a suitable C compiler is installed and the standard math library  *math.h*.
