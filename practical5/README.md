# Overview
* This is the fifth practical in which there are three programs that will be compiled and executed.
	* First program is using and understanding the scanf function.
	* Second program is Fibonacci series.
	* Third program is Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent function.
## To compile:
1. Scanf:
gcc -o scanf using_scanf.c

2. Fibonacci Series:
gcc -o fibo fibo.c -lm

3. Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent Function:
gcc -o arctanh arctanh.c -lm

## To execute:
1. Scanf: 
./scanf

2. FIbonacci Series:
./fibo

3. Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent Function:
./arctanh
